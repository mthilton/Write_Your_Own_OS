# Write Your Own OS

This is a a repo following my progress writing my own Operating System. The Majority of this code is going to come from a [CodePulse video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkrpUaGThTQ&list=PLZQftyCk7_SeZRitx5MjBKzTtvk0pHMtp), however I will change some things as I see fit.

## Differences

1. My implementation currntly uses C++ rather than C; I prefer C++ to C. This is subject to change as I develop this OS.

## Required Software/Libraries

1. Docker to ensure the same working environment.
